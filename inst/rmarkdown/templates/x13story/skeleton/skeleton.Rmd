## A main header

This is a template for X-13 stories, descriptions of seasonal adjustment
discussions that can be turned into PDFs or into interactive stories.
For a more extensive description of the approach, see the
[vignette](https://github.com/christophsax/x13story/raw/master/vignettes/wrokflow.pdf).

Use `h2` header (`##`) as top headers, so you can wrap several stories in a
book, separating them with `h1` headers (`#`).

To initiate a new page in an **interactive story**, use `x13page()`. The function
takes an object of class `"seas"` as its first argment, and a chararacter string
describing the series shown on the page as its second. For a list of all 
available series, see the `series` function from the seasonal package. 

Everything you write after a call to `x13page()` will appeare on that page. To start a new page, simply invoke `x13page()` again.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x13page(m, "main", pdf = FALSE)
```


By default `x13page()` will also inlclude a plot into a **PDF**, but this can be
changed by setting `pdf = FALSE`.  If you want to include a customized graph in
a PDF, the `prettify()` function allows you to give seasonal and R base plots a
look that works well with the document template. Note that this plot will not 
appear in an interactive story:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A pretty time series in my PDF."}
prettify(plot(final(m), main = "", xlab = "", ylab = "Passengers, in 1000"))
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A second X-13 view."}
library(x13story)

myseries <- structure(c(112, 118, 132, 129, 121, 135, 148, 148, 136, 119,

m <- seas(myseries, x11 = "")

# initializes a second X-13 view
x13page(m, 'x11.seasonal')
```


### A sub header

You can use arbitrary code in your document. Note that evaluations of R code are
not shown in interactive stories.

```
dput(AirPassengers)
``` 

You can also use \LaTeX-style math both for PDFs and and the interactive view:

$$X_t = T_t + S_t + I_t$$ 

Inlined math, $E = mc^2$, is possible as well.

You can include your own data into the code. Use `dput` to transform an existing series in your workspace into R code:


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "And and example of a pretty QQ-plot in my PDF."}
prettify(qqnorm(resid(m), main = "", xlab = ""))
```
