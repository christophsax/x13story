```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# also loads seasonal
library(x13story)  
```

## A main header

This is a template for X-13 stories, descriptions of seasonal adjustment
discussions that can be turned into PDFs or into interactive stories.
For a more extensive description of the approach, see the
[vignette](https://github.com/christophsax/x13story/raw/master/vignettes/wrokflow.pdf).

Use `h2` header (`##`) as top headers, so you can wrap several stories in a
book, separating them with `h1` headers (`#`).

To initiate a new page in an **interactive story**, use `x13page()`. The function
takes an object of class `"seas"` as its first argment, and a chararacter string
describing the series shown on the page as its second. For a list of all 
available series, see the `series` function from the seasonal package.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
m <- seas(AirPassengers)
x13page(m, "main")

```

If you want to include a graph in a **PDF**, the `prettify()` function allows
you to give seasonal and R base plots a look that works well with the document
template.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A pretty time series in my PDF."}
prettify(plot(m, main = " "))

```

You can use both interactive and PDF functions in the same doucument. If you
render your document als a PDF, the interactive functions will be ingnored. If
you render it as an interactive story, the PDF functions wiell be ignored.


### A sub header

You can use arbitrary code in your document, which is evaluated if not stated 
otherwise:

```
dput(AirPassengers)

``` 

You can also use \LaTeX-style math both for PDFs and and the interactive view:

$$X_t = T_t + S_t + I_t$$ 

Inlined math, $E = mc^2$, is possible as well.

You can include your own data into the code. Use `dput` to transform an existing series in your workspace into R code:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A second X-13 view."}
library(x13story)

# initializes a second X-13 view
x13page(m, 'x11.seasonal')

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "And and example of a pretty Monthplot in my PDF."}
prettify(monthplot(m, main = " "))
